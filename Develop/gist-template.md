## Regex Components

### Anchors
 Anchors don't technically match any sort of characters, but they assert that the search engine matches the location of the string
### Quantifiers
 Quantifiers talk about the character group or character class must be present in the input.
### OR Operator
 Part of the regular expression operators. Click the link below for more info:

### Character Classes
 Character classes distinguish kinds of characters such as, for example, distinguishing between letters and digits.
### Flags
 Flag to the regex modifies the way the search engine acts
### Grouping and Capturing
 Catching group memorizes information about a match, and access through the results
### Bracket Expressions
 Regular expressions provide a mechanism  to set certain strings from a set of characters strings.
### Greedy and Lazy Match
 Greedy match tries to match the pattern at that positon, if there isn't any it goes to the next positon. Lazy match repeats the minimal number of times.
### Boundaries
 There are three different positions that make boundaries
 - Before the first character in the string, if the first character is a word character.
 - After the last character in the string, if the last character is a word character.
 - Between two characters in the string, where one is a word character and the other is not a word character.

### Back-references
 Backreference refers to the match of the group previously and matches the same text as that group.
### Look-ahead and Look-behind
 These are comonly part of the regix apprentice know as Lookarounds. Click the link below for more info:
